## Instructions
### :thought_balloon: General Tips

Several tools make use of mottie's [tablesorter](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/#Introduction) plugin, which includes useful additional features such as multi-column sorting with <kbd>Shift</kbd> or special characters for [filtering](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-filter.html).

We recommend installing Jack's extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jacks-mousehunt-helper/ghfmjkamilolkalibpmokjigalmncfek), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jacks-mousehunt-helper/)) if you have not already. It records important variables from **active hunts** only. Most of the data for new releases and features are a direct result of Jack publicly sharing his database. With your help, we will be able to implement new areas sooner with higher degrees of accuracy. :rocket:

### :bookmark: Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are pieces of JavaScript code that are saved as a bookmark in the user's browser, enabling them to interact with webpages on the fly. We provide 6 different bookmarklets (CRE, Setup, Map, Analyzer, Crown, and the all-in-one Loader), each located underneath the title of its corresponding tool's page.

You **must** be on the official [mousehuntgame.com](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/) website for our bookmarklets to work. This is because the Facebook version loads MouseHunt in an `<iframe>` which prevents access to DOM elements as well as the custom `user` JavaScript object.

We recommend using the Auto-Loader, as it automatically grabs the latest version of each bookmarklet without having to manually update them.

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/img/instructions-autoloader.jpg">
  <br><i>Auto-Loader v1.1</i>
</p>

Bookmarklet | Functionality
:--: | --
CRE | Automatically fills in the Catch Rate Estimator with your location, sublocation, cheese, charm, weapon, base, charm, and more
Setup | Gradually loads your owned weapons, bases, and charms into Best Setup by passing them in via URL over multiple redirects
Analyzer | Gradually loads in your entire Marketplace transaction history via URL over multiple redirects
Map | Automatically fills in the Map Solver's mouse name `textarea` with all of the remaining uncaught mice on your Active Map
Crown | Automatically fills in the Crown Solver's `textarea` with the 30 Bronze mice on your 'King's Crowns' page that are closest to reaching Silver status (100 catches). The rest of the Bronze mice are copied to your clipboard for pasting if desired (bugs?)
Loader | Generates a pop-up dialog that gives you access to the latest versions of each bookmarklet

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

<p align="center">
  <br><b id="Browser-Tips">Browser Installation Tips</b><br>
  Drag the blue bookmarklet link to your browser's bookmarks bar. If that doesn't work, try the following manual instructions. These concepts apply to other browsers (including mobile), but specific processes may vary.<br><br>
  <img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/chrome_12-48/chrome_12-48_32x32.png" alt="Chrome" id="Chrome"><br>
  <i>Chrome</i><br>
</p>

1. Bookmark an arbitrary page and name it something memorable, like 'CRE' or 'Auto-Loader'
1. Copy the bookmarklet code by right-clicking the link and selecting `Copy link address`
1. Right-click on your newly created bookmark and select `Edit...`
1. Paste the bookmarklet code into the `URL` field and hit `Save`

<p align="center">
  <br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/firefox_23-56/firefox_23-56_32x32.png" alt="Firefox" id="Firefox"><br>
  <i>Firefox</i><br>
</p>

1. Right-click on the bookmarklet link, select `Bookmark This Link`, and name it accordingly.

<p align="center">
  <br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/edge/edge_32x32.png" alt="Edge" id="Edge"> <img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/internet-explorer_9-11/internet-explorer_9-11_32x32.png" alt="Edge" id="Edge"><br>
  <i>Edge / IE</i><br>
</p>

1. There does not seem to be native support in Edge for saving a bookmark directly from a link or for editing a bookmark's URL (at least on my machine). The 'Reading List' feature doesn't seem to work for this purpose either. However, there is a third-party application for Edge called [EdgeManage](http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html) that purports to add a lot of missing features for managing your favorites - use at your own discretion.

1. Internet Explorer 11 allows you to drag bookmarklets directly to your favorites bar as well as right-click and `Add to favorites...`. However, it doesn't seem to support certain JavaScript features that enable our bookmarklets to run properly.

<p align="center">
  <br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/safari_1-7/safari_1-7_32x32.png" alt="Safari" id="Safari"><br>
  <i>Safari</i><br>
</p>

1. Bookmark an arbitrary page and give it a memorable name
1. Right-click on the bookmarklet link and select `Copy Link`
1. Right-click on the newly created bookmark, select `Edit Address`, paste into the text box, then click `Done`

<!-- ### :earth_americas: Map Solver and Mouse Finder  ([Link](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/map.html)) -->
### :earth_americas: [Map Solver and Mouse Finder](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/map.html)

<p>Based on Chad's and <a href="http://olf.github.io/mhmapsolver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olaf's</a> solvers.</p>

<p>Copy and paste mice from maps, or type names leaving a line break between each. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to autocomplete and <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through autocomplete suggestions.</p>

Type of Attraction Rate | Description
:--: | --
Raw | Shown for individual mice
Total | Sum for a specific location, sublocation, cheese, and charm
Weighted | Same as Total AR, but with baseline cheese attraction rates factored in

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

---

### :trophy: [Best Setup](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/setup.html)

> Calculates the best weapon and base setup to use for a particular location, sublocation, and cheese.

*Note:* This tool will be receiving optimizations in the near future to reduce lengthy loading times and store owned items more efficiently.

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

---

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: [Marketplace Analyzer](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/analyzer.html)

> Provides a record of every marketplace transaction as well as summary tables with useful aggregations.

Type | Description
:--: | --
Transaction | Gold spent or received in a single trade
Amount | Total spent or received for a single item and action, including tariffs
Price | Amount รท Quantity
Unit Price | Gold spent on a single unit in a transaction
Tariffs | 10% calculated on total amount  = Amount รท 1.1 (slightly inaccurate)

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

### :crown: [Crown Solver](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/crown.html)

> Calculates the best locations to hunt to progress towards achieving 100 catches of mouse breeds.

This spin-off of the Map Solver by vsong factors in the difference between 100 and the number of catches you currently have for a breed (e.g. all else being equal, a mouse at 99 catches is weighted more heavily than one at 80 catches).

Type of Crown Progress | Description
:--: | --
Raw | Shown for individual mice, factors in attraction rate and catches remaining until 100
Total | Sum for a specific location, sublocation, cheese, and charm
Weighted | Same as Total CP, but with baseline cheese attraction rates factored in

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

---

### :bookmark_tabs: [CRE Tabbed Demo](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/tabs.html)

> Provides a convenient way to spin up multiple independent instances of the CRE tool. Each instance is located in its own `<iframe>` and setups are easily copy-pasted between tabs. Great way quickly to compare setups that are mostly identical.

Keyboard Shortcut | Description
:--: | --
<kbd>Alt + C</kbd> | Copy setup in current tab
<kbd>Alt + V</kbd> | Paste setup to current tab
<kbd>โ</kbd> <kbd>โ</kbd> | Navigate between tabs (when one is highlighted)

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

## Developers

### :construction_worker: Build

Certain files (like wisdom values and populations) are generated by Travis CI when the master branch is pushed.

To build these files locally, run `npm install` then `npm run build`

### :barber: Coding Style

We use ESLint ([`config-airbnb-base`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)) configured with Prettier ([`prettier/recommended`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/eslint.html#why-not-both)) to enforce consistent coding conventions.

*This is still a work in progress, along with converting the codebase to align with modern ES2015+ JavaScript best practices.*
